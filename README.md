Introduction
This project is a Java-based application that generates and solves mazes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The primary goal is to demonstrate the DFS algorithm and its implementation in Java.

Features -
  1.Generates mazes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm
  2.Solves mazes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm
  3.Visualization of maze generation and solving processes
  4.Command-line interface for generating and solving mazes
  5.Configurable maze dimensions
